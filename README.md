# ai-factory

ai-factory turns a repository task into a controlled coding-agent run:

    Issue -> FactoryTask -> sandbox -> agent -> validation -> branch/commit -> PR or MR

The orchestration layer is provider-neutral. It can read GitHub or GitLab issue
events, clone the repository described by the event, run a configured agent in
an agent-sandbox environment, report status back to the issue, and create an
idempotent pull request or merge request.

## Supported execution architectures

The project uses two execution paths:

- GitHub projects use GitHub Actions and a temporary kind cluster.
- GitLab projects use GitLab Runner and a temporary kind cluster.

In both paths ai-factory supplies the common task model, sandbox plan, agent
runner, Git authentication, validation, failure classification, retry policy,
issue comments, and PR/MR creation. A permanent Kubernetes cluster is optional;
it is only needed for a shared, always-on runtime or high task volume.

The step-by-step setup for both providers is in
docs/guide.md.

## Repository structure

- components/agent-sandbox: installs the agent-sandbox controllers.
- components/agent-sandbox-images/coding-agent: builds the generic coding image.
- components/factory-task: installs the FactoryTask CRD and runtime components.
- factory/pkg/task: provider-neutral task, webhook, agent-plan, status, and
  change-request logic.
- .github/workflows/issue-factorytask.yaml: GitHub Issue to kind to PR flow.
- .github/workflows/ai-factory-issue-reusable.yaml: reusable GitHub workflow
  for other repositories.
- .gitlab-ci.yml: GitLab Runner to kind to MR flow.
- examples: hand-written GitHub and GitLab FactoryTask examples.

## Agent model and runner configuration

The default command is:

    ai-factory-agent openai-compatible

This runner works with any provider that exposes a compatible
chat/completions endpoint. The model provider is selected at runtime:

    OPENAI_API_KEY=...
    OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com/v1
    OPENAI_MODEL=provider-model

Kimi, OpenAI-compatible gateways, self-hosted models, and other compatible
providers can use the same runner. The names OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_BASE_URL,
and OPENAI_MODEL describe the protocol contract, not a required vendor.

An alternate CLI can be selected without changing ai-factory:

    AGENT_COMMAND="ai-factory-agent codex"

or with spec.agent.command on a hand-written FactoryTask. The coding image
does not require a specific provider CLI.

## Local Kubernetes setup

The installers use the active kubectl context and work with kind, a native
Kubernetes cluster, or GKE. Select a context first:

    kubectl config use-context <cluster-context>
    kubectl cluster-info

Install agent-sandbox, then build or load the coding-agent image. For a kind
cluster:

    export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
    IMAGE_PREFIX=localhost/ai-factory/ \
    IMAGE_TAG=dev \
    KIND_CLUSTER_NAME=<kind-cluster-name> \
    AGENT_SANDBOX_SRC=/path/to/agent-sandbox \
    components/agent-sandbox/install

Install the FactoryTask CRD:

    components/factory-task/install

Validate, inspect, or run a hand-written task:

    go run ./factory/cmd/factory task validate examples/factory-task-github.yaml
    go run ./factory/cmd/factory task plan examples/factory-task-gitlab.yaml
    go run ./factory/cmd/factory task controller manifest examples/factory-task-github.yaml
    go run ./factory/cmd/factory task controller run-once examples/factory-task-github.yaml

For a long-running local controller:

    go run ./factory/cmd/factory task controller watch --namespace default

The full provider setup, secrets, labels, runner prerequisites, and
troubleshooting steps are in docs/guide.md and
components/factory-task/README.md.

## GitHub issue tasks

The GitHub Actions workflow listens for Issue labeled and reopened events,
creates a temporary kind cluster, installs agent-sandbox, creates a
FactoryTask, and runs the watch controller.

Use these labels:

- ai-factory: identifies a task for this repository's automation.
- ai-factory-run: permits the real agent, branch, commit, push, and PR flow.
- ai-factory-smoke: runs the safe smoke change-request flow.

Configure the API key as a repository secret and provider settings as repository
variables. See docs/guide.md for the exact GitHub UI steps.

## GitLab issue tasks

The GitLab CI template runs the same FactoryTask flow on a GitLab Runner. The
runner creates a temporary kind cluster, installs agent-sandbox, builds the
coding image, reads the Issue through the GitLab API, and creates a merge
request after successful validation.

Set AI_FACTORY_ISSUE_IID when a pipeline is started for an Issue. Set
AI_FACTORY_SOURCE_URL when the target project consumes ai-factory from a
separate GitLab mirror or repository. See docs/guide.md for protected
variables, runner tags, webhook routing, and the required Docker privileges.

## Quick Start

You can run the project's Go tests locally with a single command:

    go test ./...

This runs the full Go test suite across all packages in the repository. Make sure you have a recent Go toolchain installed before running it.

## Development

Run the Go test suite:

    go test ./...

Validate shell scripts and YAML files before committing. Do not place API keys,
provider tokens, generated prompts, or task instructions in commits.
