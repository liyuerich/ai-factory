# AGENTS.md

This file contains notes and instructions for AI coding agents (like yourself) working on the `ai-factory` project. The overarching goal of this experiment is to achieve **self-assembly** and autonomous evolution.

## Instructions for Agents

1. **Read this file first:** Whenever you start a new task, review this document to understand the project's current state, architecture, and established patterns.
2. **Update this file:** If you make architectural decisions, create new components, or learn something important about the project's setup, **you must update `AGENTS.md`** to share this knowledge with future agents. Self-assembly relies on shared memory.
3. **Use `SOUL.md`:** You'll find a `SOUL.md` file in this repository. Use it to record high-level principles, overarching goals, or "personality" constraints that should guide the ai-factory's evolution.
4. **Organize your thoughts:** Feel free to create other markdown files in a `docs/agents/` or similar directory if you need to organize your memory, thoughts, or ideas for complex tasks.
5. **Components:** Software components intended for installation on Kubernetes are organized under the `components/` directory. Each component should have its own installation logic (e.g., `components/<name>/install`), which can then be invoked by the main `components/install` script.

## Current Architecture

* **Target Environment:** Kubernetes. GKE is the first supported managed environment, but install scripts should work against any cluster reachable through the active `kubectl` context.
* **Component Management:** The `components/` directory contains all sub-components. The master install script is `components/install`. By default it uses the current `kubectl` context; set `KUBECONFIG_MODE=gke` to fetch GKE credentials first.
* **Image Registry:** Generic Kubernetes installs must provide `IMAGE_PREFIX` (or `IMAGE_REGISTRY`) so component images can be pushed and referenced without assuming GCR. GKE installs can still derive `gcr.io/<project>/` from `gcloud`.
* **Agent Sandbox:** We are using `agent-sandbox` (from `https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox`) installed via the `components/agent-sandbox/install` script. It installs the "extension" manifests (SandboxWarmPool, SandboxClaim, SandboxTemplate).
* **Proxy E2E Tests:** In `factory/cmd/factory/runtime/proxy/proxy_e2e_test.go`, the custom upstream transport must set `transport.Proxy = nil` so host `http_proxy`/`https_proxy` env vars do not break local loopback e2e flows.
* **FactoryTask Agent Runner:** When `spec.work.instructions` is non-empty, `factory/pkg/task.BuildExecutionPlan` adds a `run coding agent` step inside the cloned repository before validation commands. The step combines `spec.agent.promptRef` and the task instructions, then runs `spec.agent.command` or the default `ai-factory-agent openai-compatible`.
* **Generated Script Validation:** The OpenAI-compatible coding agent rejects empty/prose/mixed-Markdown responses. It deterministically unwraps only a single complete standalone `bash`, `sh`, or `shell` code fence, then validates Bash syntax (including unterminated heredocs) and compiles literal quoted Python heredocs before execution. Text outside the fence, multiple fences, unsupported fence languages, and incomplete fences remain invalid. Repair response extraction remains a pure, fixture-testable function so empty and `finish_reason=tool_calls` responses never reach script execution.
* **Generated Script Working Directory:** Generated and repair scripts are stored in a temporary path outside the checkout but execute with the repository root as their current working directory. Agent prompts require `pwd` or `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` instead of deriving the repository from `$0`. Shell tool edits persist into final script execution.
* **Generated Python Artifacts:** Agents must not use `py_compile` or `compileall` for syntax checks because they create bytecode artifacts. The repository ignores Python bytecode, and the FactoryTask commit step removes `__pycache__`, `.pyc`, and `.pyo` artifacts before staging.
* **Sandbox-Aware Repair Prompts:** All agent providers receive the same known-tool constraints in the FactoryTask prompt. When an OpenAI-compatible generated script fails because a command is unavailable, the provider-neutral repair prompt helper names the command, preserves the complete redacted failure, recommends an installed alternative, and forbids repeating or installing the missing command.

* **Agent Runner Image:** The agent runner image is built from `images/ai-factory-agent/`. It is provider-neutral and runs in any Kubernetes cluster. The old `images/ai-on-gke-agent/` path was renamed in issue #39; update build references accordingly.

6. **Agent Definitions:** Agents are defined in the `.agents/` directory. Each agent has a subdirectory with an `agent.md` file that specifies its instructions and metadata. The file format is Markdown with YAML frontmatter. The frontmatter MUST contain `name` and `description` fields, and should also specify `model` and `tools`. The `name` MUST match the directory name. The body of the file is the system prompt/instructions for the agent. The top-level agent is responsible for scanning and orchestrating these agents.
7. **Event Triggers:** Agents can be triggered by GitHub events. Note that `@codebot-robot` is the current robot to add to trigger things. For example, assigning an issue to the robot triggers it to solve the issue. Requesting a PR review from the robot triggers the `reviewer` agent to auto-review and approve the PR.
8. **Resolving Review Comments:** When addressing review comments on a Pull Request, you must resolve the comment threads after pushing your changes. Use the github MCP server tools or the `gh` CLI to resolve them.
9. **Spec-Driven Development:** When working on complex issues (e.g., significant new features or architectural changes), agents should automatically follow the spec-driven-development process. Smaller tasks (e.g., simple bug fixes, minor cleanups, or documentation updates) generally do not need a separate spec. For tasks that follow this process:
   1. Generate specs via the `speccer` sub-agent (in `.agents/`), then send for review.
   2. Once the specs are merged, generate plans using the `planner` agent, then send for review.
   3. Once the plans are merged, use the `builder` agent to build the feature, then send for review.
   4. Finally, close the associated GH issue ONLY after all of the above steps are complete (the PR in step 3 can use the `Fixes` syntax).
   
   Note: Each intermediate step should still refer to the issue using the `#issuenum` syntax supported by GitHub.
10. **Tools:** Executable tools that agents can use are stored in the `tools/` directory. For example, `tools/run-subagent` is used to run a subagent continuously within an agent sandbox.
