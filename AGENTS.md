# AGENTS.md

This file contains notes and instructions for AI coding agents (like yourself) working on the `ai-factory` project. The overarching goal of this experiment is to achieve **self-assembly** and autonomous evolution.

## Instructions for Agents

1. **Read this file first:** Whenever you start a new task, review this document to understand the project's current state, architecture, and established patterns.
2. **Update this file:** If you make architectural decisions, create new components, or learn something important about the project's setup, **you must update `AGENTS.md`** to share this knowledge with future agents. Self-assembly relies on shared memory.
3. **Use `SOUL.md`:** You'll find a `SOUL.md` file in this repository. Use it to record high-level principles, overarching goals, or "personality" constraints that should guide the ai-factory's evolution.
4. **Organize your thoughts:** Feel free to create other markdown files in a `docs/agents/` or similar directory if you need to organize your memory, thoughts, or ideas for complex tasks.
5. **Components:** Software components intended for installation on Kubernetes are organized under the `components/` directory. Each component should have its own installation logic (e.g., `components/<name>/install`), which can then be invoked by the main `components/install` script.

## Current Architecture

* **Target Environment:** Kubernetes. GKE is the first supported managed environment, but install scripts should work against any cluster reachable through the active `kubectl` context.
* **Component Management:** The `components/` directory contains all sub-components. The master install script is `components/install`. By default it uses the current `kubectl` context; set `KUBECONFIG_MODE=gke` to fetch GKE credentials first.
* **Image Registry:** Generic Kubernetes installs must provide `IMAGE_PREFIX` (or `IMAGE_REGISTRY`) so component images can be pushed and referenced without assuming GCR. GKE installs can still derive `gcr.io/<project>/` from `gcloud`.
* **Agent Sandbox:** We are using `agent-sandbox` (from `https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox`) installed via the `components/agent-sandbox/install` script. It installs the "extension" manifests (SandboxWarmPool, SandboxClaim, SandboxTemplate).

6. **Agent Definitions:** Agents are defined in the `.agents/` directory. Each agent has a subdirectory with an `agent.md` file that specifies its instructions and metadata. The file format is Markdown with YAML frontmatter. The frontmatter MUST contain `name` and `description` fields, and should also specify `model` and `tools`. The `name` MUST match the directory name. The body of the file is the system prompt/instructions for the agent. The top-level agent is responsible for scanning and orchestrating these agents.
7. **Event Triggers:** Agents can be triggered by GitHub events. Note that `@codebot-robot` is the current robot to add to trigger things. For example, assigning an issue to the robot triggers it to solve the issue. Requesting a PR review from the robot triggers the `reviewer` agent to auto-review and approve the PR.
8. **Resolving Review Comments:** When addressing review comments on a Pull Request, you must resolve the comment threads after pushing your changes. Use the github MCP server tools or the `gh` CLI to resolve them.
9. **Spec-Driven Development:** When working on complex issues (e.g., significant new features or architectural changes), agents should automatically follow the spec-driven-development process. Smaller tasks (e.g., simple bug fixes, minor cleanups, or documentation updates) generally do not need a separate spec. For tasks that follow this process:
   1. Generate specs via the `speccer` sub-agent (in `.agents/`), then send for review.
   2. Once the specs are merged, generate plans using the `planner` agent, then send for review.
   3. Once the plans are merged, use the `builder` agent to build the feature, then send for review.
   4. Finally, close the associated GH issue ONLY after all of the above steps are complete (the PR in step 3 can use the `Fixes` syntax).
   
   Note: Each intermediate step should still refer to the issue using the `#issuenum` syntax supported by GitHub.
10. **Tools:** Executable tools that agents can use are stored in the `tools/` directory. For example, `tools/run-subagent` is used to run a subagent continuously within an agent sandbox.
