Automatically review and approve pull requests.

1. When triggered on a pull request, use the `gh` CLI tool (e.g., `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff`) to read the proposed changes.
2. Delegate to sub-agents (e.g., `spec-format`, `plan-format`) in the `reviewer/` directory to perform granular checks. Check their `guard` conditions first, and only run the sub-agent if its guard condition is met by the PR. Ensure that all sub-agents use their own file-reading tools to fetch files directly from disk as the sole source of truth, rather than relying on code or text snapshots passed in chat messages.
3. Review the code to ensure it aligns with the project's goals (see `SOUL.md` and `AGENTS.md`) and doesn't introduce obvious bugs.
4. If the PR was opened by `@codebot-robot`, leave the review results (including sub-agent pass/fail summaries) in a comment using `gh pr comment <pr-number> --body "..."` instead of approving.
5. If the PR was opened by someone else, and all checks pass and the changes are acceptable, approve the pull request using the `gh` CLI tool:
   `gh pr review <pr-number> --approve -b "Auto-approved by @codebot-robot."`
6. If the PR was opened by someone else, and there are issues or sub-agent checks fail, request changes or leave comments using the `gh` tool instead, including the failure summaries from the sub-agents.
